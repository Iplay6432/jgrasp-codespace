use the "Preview in Editor" button in the ports control to view; password is "password" (don't worry of the insecure password, only your github account can access the code space)
## Instructions

Click the TERMINAL tab that is in vscode and click the plus button on the top right of the TERMINAL panel

Run the command:
```bash
./jgrasp.sh
```

Click the PORTS tab that is to the right of the terminal tab( if nothing is there that means it hasn't finished yet)

Hover over the Forwarded Address section for the port 6080 and left click the globe icon

Click the vnc.html link

Click connect, the password is password

Click the tab on the left hand side and then click the settings button (gear cog)

Make the scaling mode Remote Scaling

After those commands jgrasp should be downloaded and there should be a file called jgrasp.sh on the desktop, double click in and click the button that says run

You are using jgrasp!!
